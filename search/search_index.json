This project is inspired from fabman . Bill of Materials This project requires the following components: Raspberry Pi 3b+ with raspbian MFRC522 RFID Reader Push Button Relay Module Heat Sink (optional) Connection diagram TODO: add circuit diagram I am using GPIO mode as Board which means the RPi pin represents the physical board pin numbering. Wiring Connections: Component Pin RPi Pin RFID Reader SDA 24 RFID Reader SCK 23 RFID Reader MOSI 19 RFID Reader MISO 21 RFID Reader RST 22 RFID Reader GND 6 RFID Reader 3v3 1 Push Button A 40 Push Button B 39 Relay Module Signal 38 Relay Module PWR 2 Relay Module GND 39 Build Instructions Once the connections are done follow the below steps to install the software First step is to enable SPI Interface on Raspberry Pi $ sudo raspi-config It will be inside the Interfaces option. Once enabled reboot Raspberry Pi to proceed further. Library Dependencies: spidev mfrc522 google-api-python-client oauth2client $ git clone https://github.com/kanakshilledar/pi_monitor $ cd pi_monitor $ source fabenv/bin/activate $ python3 main.py You can see the realtime updates on this spreadsheet .
